## 1. What is an IXP?

## 2. What is a server?

There are two popular uses of the word "server".

First, there is the computer program, the process that binds to a socket and accepts client connections.

Second, there is the hardware: a physical computer used to run the server software.

## 3. What is a client?

A client is software that initiates a connection to a server. While a server binds to a (usually low-number) port and waits for connections, a client sends requests through ephemeral ports to the waiting server port.
